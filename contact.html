Work experience
Your computer science course may include a year in industry, which will give you the opportunity to develop commercial skills and build up a network of contacts.

If your course doesn't offer this, look for IT-related work placements, internships or shadowing opportunities advertised via your careers service or through companies such as Step and Year in Industry.

It's useful to develop a personal portfolio of your own projects, such as those involving programming, building a website or game, or carrying out tasks online as a moderator. Evidence of, for example, your initiative and ability in fixing bugs, improving functionality or building an app will help show your skills and interest in the subject.

Some university clubs or societies can give you the chance to develop your computing, web design or multimedia skills and this can also be helpful when applying for graduate jobs.
